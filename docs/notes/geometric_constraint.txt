A geometric constraint problem <GCP> consists of 

		a set of geometric objects
		a set of constraints between them

A geometric constraint graph G = (V,E,w) corresponding to a
GCP is a weighted graph with n vertices ( representing entries in the object set ),
V and m edges ( constraints ) E, w(v) is the weight of vertex v, and 
w(e) is the weight of edge e. This G consists of
	
		a set V of geometric objects	
		a set E of constraints between objects in V
		an assignment w assigning weights to objects in V + E

The following definitions relate notions of solvability of the 
geometric constraint system to the corresponding constraint graph.

A subgraph A contained in G that satisfies

	sum(e in A)(w(e) + D) >= sum(v in A)(w(e))

is called dense, where D is a dimension-dependent constant.

d(A) = sum(e in A)(w(e)) - sum(v in A)(w(v)) is called the density of a graph A.

D is typically set as (d+1 choose 2) where d is the dimension. D captures the degrees
of freedom associated with the cluster of geometric objects corresponding to the dense
graph. In general, we use the words subgraph, and cluster interchangeably. 

A dense graph with density > -D is called overconstrained.
A dense graph all of whose subgraphs have density <= -D is wellconstrained.
A graph G is welloverconstrained if it satisfies the following: 
G is dense, G has at least one over constrained subgraph, and has
the property that on replacing all over constrained subgraphs by 
well constrained subgraphs, G remains dense.

A graph that is well constrained or welloverconstrained is said to be solvable.

A dense graph is minimal if it has no proper dense subgraph. all minimal dense
subgraphs are solvable, but the converse is not true. A graph that is not solvable
is said to be under constrained. GSP has two aspects, a combinatorial aspect as
well as a geometric aspect. the geometric aspect deals with the parameters of the
GSP, while the combinatorial aspect deals with objects and constraints.
