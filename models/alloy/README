Instead of using a traditional representation of geometric objects by locating spacial boundaries and volumes in space - as clouds of points that are only differentiated by their current locations in space - Set takes a notion of logical constraint between geometric elements as primitive. That is to say, instead of representing a cube as a set of points { x1, x2, .., x8 }, that happen to be located in a cubic configuration at the time of viewing, Set represents a cube as a series of invariants between geometries - ie. a set of parallel, perpindicular, and coincident lines. In this way, Set encodes the "logic" of what it means to be Cube into the represented geometry, rather than relying on an incidental configuration of random points. Being able to bake these invariants into a drawing allows the user to make sound logical judgements about their form - a key ability when it comes to automated manufacturing, systems integration, and reasoning about form.

[2] . Data Structures in Set and Their Represenation in Alloy.

Instead of encoding points as locations, Set encodes points as ordered n-tuples of symbols, each of which varies over the Real numbers. The symbols in a point never change once the point is defined; their values may, as constraints are imposed and satisfied by the solver.

Set uses a lightweight, inductive definition to define Geometry, as follows:

	x : Symbol    y : Symbol   z : Symbol
	------------------------------------- ( PointIntro )
	         [ x y z ] : Geometry

	    A : Geometry    B : Geometry
	------------------------------------- ( RelationIntro )
	        ( A, B ) : Geometry

All more complicated geometric structures are encoded as relations between points. For examples, a line is a simple relation between points, a plane is a relation between lines, and a volume a relation between planes. Relations of greater depth than this have more than 3 dimensions; one might visualize a relation between volumes ( ie, a relation between relations between relations between relations between points ) as a transition function from the "A" volume into the "B" volume. NB, Set does not implement this representation.
