		In SET, Geometry is defined as a simple, inductive relation:
		
		a Geometry may be either:

			a)				A "Point" consisting of Symbols x, y, and z.
			b)				A binary "Relation" between other two other geometries A and B

		In essence, a Geometry is a simple binary tree structure. In addition to this,
		we impose the constraint that Geometries are perfectly balanced, ie, the subtrees of
		relations must have the same depth, given by the usual depth measure on binary trees. 		

		In terms of visualization, a relation between points may be (is) visualized as a straight
		line between those point's locations in 3 space, a relation between lines is the plane contained
		between the lines, relation between planes as the volume contained between them, a relation between
		volumes as a path space mapping the elements of the left volume into the right volume ( an animation, perhaps? ).
